                            <p>Our customers/clients are mostly, but not limited to, pet owners. We’re also partnering with different Veterinary Clinics which allows the pet patient’s parent to have an idea about their pet remains if an unfortunate event happens. In addition, we will also partner with Pet Shop Owners to help them with the deceased pets in case there are unforeseen events occur.</p>
                            <h3>VALUE PROPOSITION</h3>
                            <p>Pawradise understands the significance of each visit to your loved ones. We want to maximize the experience by making sure every minute you spend at the park is worth your while.
                                Memorial parks serve the transcendental purpose of providing a final resting place where family members can mourn and honor the dead for many years. We ensure that our parks have everything families will need, more so during times they need to gather in good spirits. These facilities aim to better support those grieving.
                                Memorial parks also evolved. While the solemn ambiance is preserved, these places are for celebrating life as well. A vital part of the grieving process includes spending time at the park and paying tribute to how the pet lived their life. These fun activities will help sustain the feeling of connectedness with the dearly departed and those left behind.</p>
                            <h3>CREATING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES</h3>

This exclusive service is conducted with licensed and professional Therapists and Psychologists to ensure the quality of the service provided. In addition, our service has a wide variety of options to choose from regarding handling of the earthly remains of your beloved pet which includes Cremation and Burial.
